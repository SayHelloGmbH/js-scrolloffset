# Watch window scroll offset

jQuery script which watches the window scroll position and adds/removes a CSS
class to the HTML object as appropriate.

## Usage

By including this script, no further action is necessary. The CSS class name
`s-has--scrolloffset` will be applied and can be referenced in CSS:
`html.s-has--scrolloffset {â€¦}`. The class name convention adheres to BEM 
naming conventions: `s-has` being the block identifier and `--scrolloffset`
being the modifier.
